# politico

Politico is an electoral platform for both politicians and citizens. Politico enables citizens to give their mandate to politicians running for different government offices as it builds trust in the process through transparency.

While an admin can create, update and delete political parties; also create government offices. A user can declare his/her interest to run for an office; view all political parties, view all candidates of a specific office; vote his/her choice candidates per political office, and view the list of candidates he/she voted.

# How to use the App
- A user first signs up on the app via the signup form
- signs into the app via the sign in form
- on the user's dashboard, a user can;
  - view all political parties
  - candidates running for a particular office
  - declare an interest in running for an office
  - vote his/her choice candidate for a particular political office
  - view list of all candidates he/she voted.
